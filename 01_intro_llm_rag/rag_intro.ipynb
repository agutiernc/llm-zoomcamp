You can do this by going to the directory with the docker-compose.yaml file and running:\\n\\n   docker compose up -d\\n\\n2. To run Kafka producers, consumers, or KStreams applications in Java, use the following command in the project directory:\\n\\n   java -cp build/libs/<jar_name>-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar:out src/main/java/org/example/JsonProducer.java\\n\\n   Replace <jar_name> with the actual name of your JAR file.\\n\\n3. For Python applications:\\n\\n   - Create a virtual environment:\\n     python -m venv env\\n\\n   - Activate the virtual environment:\\n     On MacOS/Linux: source env/bin/activate\\n     On Windows: env\\\\Scripts\\\\activate\\n\\n   - Install the required packages:\\n     pip install -r ../requirements.txt\\n\\n   - Run your Python script within this virtual environment\\n\\n4. If you encounter permission issues with build scripts, you may need to make them executable:\\n\\n   chmod +x build.sh\\n\\n5. For Spark applications, you can use the spark-submit.sh script:\\n\\n   ./spark-submit.sh streaming.py\\n\\nRemember to check compatibility between your local Spark version and the container version. You can check your local version with:\\n\\nspark-submit --version\\n\\nEnsure that the SPARK_VERSION in the build.sh file matches your local version.\", type='text')]"
